review
The product arrived late and customer service didn't respond to my emails.
"The shirt quality is terrible, it shrunk after the first wash."
"The delivery was delayed by 3 weeks, very disappointing."
The price was way too high for such a cheap product.
"I don't like the color of the product, it's too bright for my taste."
"I expected a better camera quality for the price, not worth it."
The customer service was rude and unhelpful when I asked for a refund.
The product worked fine but didn¡¯t match the description online.
The delivery was very slow and the package arrived damaged.
I feel like the product is overpriced for what it offers.
The item arrived as expected but the material quality is not great.
"Although the product works, I don¡¯t think it¡¯s worth the price."
The customer service team took forever to answer my questions.
"The product design is poor, not what I imagined."
The movie was boring and didn't meet my expectations at all.
The product was great but the shipping took longer than expected.
"The customer service gave me no solution to my issue, very disappointing."
The shoes fit badly and are uncomfortable to wear.
"The product was much smaller than expected, not as described."
"Not happy with the product, it broke after just two uses."
